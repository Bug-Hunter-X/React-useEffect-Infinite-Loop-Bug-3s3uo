This repository demonstrates a common bug in React's `useEffect` hook: an infinite loop caused by a missing dependency in the dependency array.  The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version. The issue arises when the `setInterval` function is not properly cleaned up because it depends on the `count` state variable, that is not included in the dependency array causing the interval to re-run indefinitely, leading to an infinite loop and potential performance issues. The solution involves adding `count` to the dependency array to correctly update the interval when the count changes.
